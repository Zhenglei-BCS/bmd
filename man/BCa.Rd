\title{Calculate BCa (Bias-Corrected and Accelerated) Bootstrap Confidence Interval}
\usage{
BCa(obs, data, bootSample, bootjack, level)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{numeric; The observed value of the statistic computed from the original sample}

\item{data}{data.frame or matrix; The original dataset from which bootstrap samples are drawn}

\item{bootSample}{numeric vector; Bootstrap replicates of the statistic. Must be of length R 
where R is the number of bootstrap replicates}

\item{bootjack}{numeric vector; Jackknife replicates of the statistic. Must be of length n 
where n is the number of observations in data}

\item{level}{numeric; Confidence level between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.95 for 95% confidence interval)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 containing:
\itemize{
  \item lower: The lower confidence limit
  \item upper: The upper confidence limit
}
}
\description{
Computes the BCa confidence interval for a statistic using bootstrap and jackknife estimates.
The BCa method adjusts for both bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution and generally
provides better coverage than standard bootstrap confidence intervals.
}
\details{
The BCa method computes confidence intervals using three components:

1. Bias correction (z0):
\deqn{z_0 = \Phi^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{number of } \theta^*_b \leq \hat{\theta}}{B}\right)}{z_0 = qnorm(proportion of bootstrap samples <= observed value)}
where B is the number of bootstrap replicates and \eqn{\theta^*_b}{theta*_b} represents the b-th bootstrap replicate.

2. Acceleration (a):
\deqn{a = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar{\theta}_{(\cdot)} - \theta_{(i)})^3}{6[\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar{\theta}_{(\cdot)} - \theta_{(i)})^2]^{3/2}}}{a = sum((theta-bar - theta_i)^3) / (6 * [sum((theta-bar - theta_i)^2)]^(3/2))}
where \eqn{\theta_{(i)}}{theta_i} are the jackknife values.

3. The confidence limits are then computed as:
\deqn{\alpha_{1,2} = \Phi\left(z_0 + \frac{z_0 \pm z_{\alpha}}{1 - a(z_0 \pm z_{\alpha})}\right)}{alpha_(1,2) = Phi(z_0 + (z_0 +/- z_alpha)/(1 - a*(z_0 +/- z_alpha)))}
}
\section{Warning}{

The function assumes that:
\itemize{
  \item The bootstrap samples are independent
  \item The statistic of interest is smooth (continuously differentiable)
  \item There are sufficient bootstrap replicates (typically >1000)
  \item The jackknife values are properly computed
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example with mean as the statistic
data <- rnorm(100)
obs_mean <- mean(data)

# Generate bootstrap samples
R <- 1000
boot_means <- replicate(R, mean(sample(data, replace = TRUE)))

# Generate jackknife samples
jack_means <- sapply(1:length(data), 
                     function(i) mean(data[-i]))

# Calculate 95\% CI
BCa(obs_mean, data, boot_means, jack_means, 0.95)
}
