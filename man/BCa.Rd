\title{Calculate BCa (Bias-Corrected and Accelerated) Bootstrap Confidence Interval}
\usage{
BCa(obs, data, bootSample, bootjack, level)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{numeric; The observed value of the statistic computed from the original sample}

\item{data}{data.frame or matrix; The original dataset from which bootstrap samples are drawn}

\item{bootSample}{numeric vector; Bootstrap replicates of the statistic. Must be of length R 
where R is the number of bootstrap replicates}

\item{bootjack}{numeric vector; Jackknife replicates of the statistic. Must be of length n 
where n is the number of observations in data}

\item{level}{numeric; Confidence level between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.95 for 95% confidence interval)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 containing:
\itemize{
  \item lower: The lower confidence limit
  \item upper: The upper confidence limit
}
}
\description{
Computes the BCa confidence interval for a statistic using bootstrap and jackknife estimates.
The BCa method adjusts for both bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution and generally
provides better coverage than standard bootstrap confidence intervals.
}
\section{Warning}{

The function assumes that:
\itemize{
  \item The bootstrap samples are independent
  \item The statistic of interest is smooth (continuously differentiable)
  \item There are sufficient bootstrap replicates (typically >1000)
  \item The jackknife values are properly computed
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example with mean as the statistic
data <- rnorm(100)
obs_mean <- mean(data)

# Generate bootstrap samples
R <- 1000
boot_means <- replicate(R, mean(sample(data, replace = TRUE)))

# Generate jackknife samples
jack_means <- sapply(1:length(data), 
                     function(i) mean(data[-i]))

# Calculate 95\% CI
BCa(obs_mean, data, boot_means, jack_means, 0.95)
}
